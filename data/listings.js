      body: "Hi all! My name is James McKellan. The picture here is My grandfathers farm in Ashland, NE in 1988. Nebraska Old Iron was started in 1964 when my grandfather, Thomas McKellan, first began collecting 1940s era cars. He first started collecting them on his farm in a small town called Eustis here in Nebraska. He then sold all of his cars including the farm to move to Ashland, Nebraska where we are located now. Since then, he has collected cars from 40s to late 80s and we now have over 3,000 cars and trucks! His prized possesions are kept in our warehouse here on the farm! Come on down! we are located at 1402 S 9th St, Ashland, NE 68003 and our phone number is (402)801-3764. Our hours are from Tue - Sat and we open at 6am and close at 6pm. We hope to see you soon!",
